\title{Abrupt 4xCO2 responses of 16 CMIP5 earth system models}
\format{
A list containing 16 dataframes, one for each climate model. Each
dataframe contains the following time series:
\itemize{
  \item \code{temp} - global mean surface temperature (K), averaged annually
  in years 1-150 of the abrupt 4xCO2 experiment.
  \item \code{flux} - top-of-the-atmosphere net downward radiative flux
  (W/m2), averaged annually in years 1-150 of the abrupt 4xCO2 experiment.
}

\description{
A dataset containing abrupt 4xCO2 responses of 16 earth system models. Data
were produced as part of the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project (CMIP5).
